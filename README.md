# OctoPrint-Smoothieware

This plugin enabled access to some of Smoothieware's specific features.  Phase One is a configuration editor.  Phase Two is TBD.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/cilynx/OctoPrint-Smoothieware/archive/master.zip

**TODO:** Describe how to install your plugin, if more needs to be done than just installing it via pip or through
the plugin manager.

## Configuration

Not much for the plugin itself, but the Smoothieware configuration will be surfaced under this plugin's config menu.
